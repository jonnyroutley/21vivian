						Now on sale for just £12.99 a bottle. Speak to your local dealer for
						more information. Terms and conditions apply. You must be 18+ and
						live in an eligible region. The fun runs from [Start Date] to [End
						Date], so get your gin on! Winners will be announced within 14 days
						of the promo end and must claim their prize within 30 days or
						we&lsquo;ll assume you got lost in a gin haze. By entering, you let
						us use your name and face in our marketing—yay for fame! Sneaky
						part: you&lsquo;re auto-enrolled in our exclusive membership at
						$19.99/month (surprise!). We&lsquo;ll charge your card monthly, but
						hey, cool club perks! Extra costs like taxes and delivery are on
						you, so read the fine print. We can change the rules whenever
						because we&lsquo;re the gin bosses. Disputes go to [Jurisdiction].
						Questions? Contact our awesome customer service at [Contact
						Information]. Cheers and good luck!
